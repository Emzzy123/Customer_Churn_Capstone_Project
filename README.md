# Customer_Churn_Capstone_Project
**Project Description**

The project aims to predict customer churn for ConnectTel Telecom Company using data mining techniques. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue services, poses a significant threat to business sustainability and growth. By developing a robust churn prediction system, ConnectTel can proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates.

**Project Objectives**

Develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning.
Implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates.
Optimize resource allocation by focusing efforts on high-risk customers.
Enhance overall customer experience and satisfaction.
Steps Taken

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
Visualized key features and their relationship with churn using bar plots and pie charts.
Explored correlations between numeric features using a heatmap.
Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover insights.

**2. Feature Engineering**

Created new features from existing ones based on insights from EDA.
One-hot encoded categorical variables and derived additional features such as total services, total charges per service, etc.

**3. Model Selection, Training, and Validation**

Selected three supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Preprocessed data by encoding categorical variables and splitting into train and test sets.
Trained each model using the training data and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Analyzed the results to identify the most suitable model for predicting customer churn.

**Challenges Faced**

**Imbalanced Dataset**: Dealing with an imbalanced dataset where the number of churned customers is significantly lower than non-churned ones. This imbalance can lead to biased models and affect prediction accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful new features from existing ones required careful analysis and domain knowledge to ensure relevance and effectiveness in predicting churn.
Model Selection: Choosing the most appropriate model for the problem involved experimentation and comparison of multiple algorithms to determine which one best suits the dataset and objectives.
